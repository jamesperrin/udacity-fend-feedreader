### Description

* This project demonstrates learning about testing with Javascript. Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD. This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application.
* The Udacity's Feed Reader Project demonstrates a Student's mastery of the Jasmine JavaScript testing framework .
* The Student is provided with a starter project containing some HTML, CSS and Jasmine files.
* The Student is responsible for writing a number of Jasmine tests against a pre-existing application..
